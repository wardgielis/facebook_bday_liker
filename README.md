# Facebook Birthday wishes liker
### A python script to automatically like birthday posts on your Facebook.
### Forked from Ebergam, changed by me to celebrate my birthday on a lazy way and hava fun little coding project! ðŸŽ‰

This script works with python's Selenium. **You should use the URL where all the birthday wishes posts are together** otherwise it will click on every like button it sees. 
The script will scroll down clicking on the 'load more' div and click the 'like' button for each post.

It works on XPATH, so it may require some tuning before use.

*After the use heartfully comment every post, showing that you aren't a soulless coder.*
